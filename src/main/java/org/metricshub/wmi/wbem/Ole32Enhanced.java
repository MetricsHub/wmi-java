	 *                         Constants. Use RPC_C_AUTHN_NONE if no authentication
	 *                         is required. If RPC_C_AUTHN_DEFAULT is specified,
	 *                         DCOM will pick an authentication service following
	 *                         its normal security blanket negotiation algorithm.
	 * @param dwAuthzSvc       [in] The authorization service to be used. For a list
	 *                         of possible values, see Authorization Constants. If
	 *                         RPC_C_AUTHZ_DEFAULT is specified, DCOM will pick an
	 *                         authorization service following its normal security
	 *                         blanket negotiation algorithm. RPC_C_AUTHZ_NONE
	 *                         should be used as the authorization service if
	 *                         NTLMSSP, Kerberos, or Schannel is used as the
	 *                         authentication service.
	 * @param pServerPrincName [in, optional] The server principal name to be used
	 *                         with the authentication service. If
	 *                         COLE_DEFAULT_PRINCIPAL is specified, DCOM will pick a
	 *                         principal name using its security blanket negotiation
	 *                         algorithm. If Kerberos is used as the authentication
	 *                         service, this value must not be NULL. It must be the
	 *                         correct principal name of the server or the call will
	 *                         fail. If Schannel is used as the authentication
	 *                         service, this value must be one of the msstd or
	 *                         fullsic forms described in Principal Names, or NULL
	 *                         if you do not want mutual authentication. Generally,
	 *                         specifying NULL will not reset the server principal
	 *                         name on the proxy; rather, the previous setting will
	 *                         be retained. You must be careful when using NULL as
	 *                         pServerPrincName when selecting a different
	 *                         authentication service for the proxy, because there
	 *                         is no guarantee that the previously set principal
	 *                         name would be valid for the newly selected
	 *                         authentication service.
	 * @param dwAuthnLevel     [in] The authentication level to be used. For a list
	 *                         of possible values, see Authentication Level
	 *                         Constants. If RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_DEFAULT is specified,
	 *                         DCOM will pick an authentication level following its
	 *                         normal security blanket negotiation algorithm. If
	 *                         this value is none, the authentication service must
	 *                         also be none.
	 * @param dwImpLevel       [in] The impersonation level to be used. For a list
	 *                         of possible values, see Impersonation Level
	 *                         Constants. If RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_DEFAULT is specified,
	 *                         DCOM will pick an impersonation level following its
	 *                         normal security blanket negotiation algorithm. If
	 *                         NTLMSSP is the authentication service, this value
	 *                         must be RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IMPERSONATE or
	 *                         RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IDENTIFY. NTLMSSP also supports
	 *                         delegate-level impersonation
	 *                         (RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_DELEGATE) on the same computer. If
	 *                         Schannel is the authentication service, this
	 *                         parameter must be RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IMPERSONATE.
	 * @param authInfo         [in, optional] COAUTHIDENTITY structure to be used for
	 *                         impersonation on a remote system through this proxy.
	 * @param dwCapabilities   [in] The capabilities of this proxy. For a list of
	 *                         possible values, see the
	 *                         EOLE_AUTHENTICATION_CAPABILITIES enumeration. The
	 *                         only flags that can be set through this function are
	 *                         EOAC_MUTUAL_AUTH, EOAC_STATIC_CLOAKING,
	 *                         EOAC_DYNAMIC_CLOAKING, EOAC_ANY_AUTHORITY (this flag
	 *                         is deprecated), EOAC_MAKE_FULLSIC, and EOAC_DEFAULT.
	 *                         Either EOAC_STATIC_CLOAKING or EOAC_DYNAMIC_CLOAKING
	 *                         can be set if pAuthInfo is not set and Schannel is
	 *                         not the authentication service. (See Cloaking for
	 *                         more information.) If any capability flags other than
	 *                         those mentioned here are set, CoSetProxyBlanket will
	 *                         fail.
	 * @return This function can return the following values.
	 *
	 *         S_OK The function was successful.
	 *
	 *         E_INVALIDARG One or more arguments is invalid.
